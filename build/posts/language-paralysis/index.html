            <article><p>Like many
self-taught developers, Javascript was my first real programming language.
Regardless of its faults, it holds a special place in my heart.  It gave me that 
first feeling of satisfaction that you get after conquering a problem that once 
seemed unconquerable.  But, in the last year or so I&#39;ve been really feeling the
itch to go deeper, to learn something new.  </p>
<p>For the most part, I don&#39;t think I ever even entertained the idea of learning a
new language.  Learning how to program was one of the most challenging things
I&#39;ve done in my life and the thought of going through the entire process again
just seemed impossible.  But as I started to grow more comfortable with some
of the more advanced Javascript topics, a new language begin looking more and
more attainable.  And now, I&#39;m up for the challenge, but the question is:  What
the heck language do I learn?</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I have some of my own irrational holdups that add to my dilemma.  You see, I was a
latecomer to programming.  I didn&#39;t start until I was 25, so I feel like I have
to make up for lost time in a way.  I&#39;m terrified of devoting a large chunk of time
to a language only to find out years later that it was the &quot;wrong&quot; language.  I
already know that this shouldn&#39;t be a concern.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;wrong&quot;
language, assuming that I&#39;m picking from a pool of languages that are actively
in use by real companies.  Any language will add depth and context to my
existing knowledge and make me a better programmer.  Regardless, I feel like I
have less time to gamble with.  </p>
<p>Another dilemma of mine is that I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve mastered
Javascript at all.  I&#39;ve never been the jack-of-all-trades sort of
person.  If I&#39;m choosing to learn something, I like to <em>really</em> learn it.  So I
have a hard time moving on to something new without feeling like I&#39;m &quot;done&quot; with
what I&#39;m learning currently.  Again, I know this irrational.  I&#39;ll likely never
be &quot;done&quot; learning a language, but it&#39;s still something I think about.</p>
<p>So, what to do?  Well, the short answer is to just pick something.  And that&#39;s
what I&#39;ll do but to try and make the decision easier, I&#39;ve made a few
prerequisites:</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>Functional</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve started to fall in love with functional programming.  It&#39;s all the rage
right now, I know, but it&#39;s so very satisfying to me.  It&#39;s challenging yet
simple, and to me just kind of <em>feels</em> better.  I&#39;ve been writing Javascript in
a more functional style and I want to focus on a language that was specifically
built with functional programming in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant (to me)</strong></p>
<p>As a frontend developer, there are really only three native languages to choose
from:  HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  However, the number of compile-to-Javascript
languages seems to be growing steadily.  Things like
<a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">Clojurescript</a> are very interesting
to me.  Learning a compile-to-JS language seems like a smart move because I
could still potentially apply to my career as a UI developer.</p>
<h2 id="candidates">Candidates</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here are some candidates that I&#39;m considering.</p>
<h3 id="-haskell-https-www-haskell-org-"><a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a></h3>
<p>An ambitious choice, but when I started digging around for what the notable
functional languages were these days, Haskell was at the top of the list.
Haskell would be a pretty giant shift for me coming from Javascript, but I do
like a challenge.  The type-checking is a popular point for proponents of
Haskell and it is indeed interesting to me.  The syntax is also very appealing
to me.  </p>
<h3 id="-elm-http-elm-lang-org-"><a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a></h3>
<p>I <em>really</em> like the idea of Elm.  I even went to a few meetups.  It&#39;s got a
Haskell-like syntax, it&#39;s functional, and it&#39;s specifically designed for
developing on the frontend.  It seemingly passes all of my prerequisites, but
I&#39;m still hesitating on it.  I think it might be a little <em>too</em> relevant to the
frontend.  I love developing UI&#39;s, but I&#39;m not throwing out the idea of
venturing into more back-end territory some day.  It&#39;d be nice if the next
language I learned would help me build up some skills in that domain as well.</p>
<h3 id="-clojure-http-clojure-org-"><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a></h3>
<p>Clojure was the sleeper language for me.  I&#39;m sure like many, the syntax almost
immediately threw me off.  But, I gave it a chance and it turns out, there&#39;s a
very good reason for the syntax being the way it is.  The very simple pattern of <code>(fn
arg arg)</code> removes a lot of the cognitive load for remembering how things are put
together.  Even though I&#39;ve only done a few tutorials, I&#39;ve already felt the
benefit of never having to remember how to call a function or what order things
were supposed to be in.  I&#39;m also really impressed and excited by the
Clojurescript community, with things like <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bhauman/devcards">Dev Cards</a>.  </p>
<h2 id="so-what-s-the-answer-">So...what&#39;s the answer???</h2>
<p>I&#39;m really leaning towards Clojure right now.  I&#39;m in the midst of reading some
books and tutorials, so we&#39;ll see if it catches on.  </p>
<p>But really, my answer is to learn all of these languages.  And I will, someday.</p>
