            <article><h1 id="advertising">Advertising</h1>
<p>About seven years ago now, I was starting my first <em>real</em> job as an ad trafficker for an online advertising company.  I was semi-fresh out of college with a Management Science degree.  Like most, I hadn&#39;t a clue about where to take my career.  Before the advertising company, I started out as a temp working mostly accounting jobs.  </p>
<p>The ad trafficking position did not excite me because I was passionate about advertising.  Rather, it excited me because the position was within a world I had always secretly wanted to be a part of:  the world of the web and technology. </p>
<p>The job involved reading a lot of code, but never writing.  The majority of the job involved copying and pasting text from one program to another.  The atmosphere was nice, but I knew it was not going to be enough to keep me satisfied in the long term.  </p>
<p>Things had not yet clicked.</p>
<p>I had friends on the engineering team who would fascinate me with their ability to write &quot;scripts&quot; for things.  &quot;How do you write these <em>scripts</em>??!&quot; I would say.  I never quite got a straight answer and at the time never thought it was something I could learn myself.  </p>
<p>After two years I was ready for something new.  I was presented with two different opportunities within the company.  One position was as a sort of data analyst and the other was a junior product manager.  Both decisions would have just been another guess for me as far as career, but I was prepared for that.  But instead of choosing either of those positions, I played a wild card...</p>
<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<p>It was about this time that I heard from a friend of mine who had recently recorded and released an album.  He would be going on tour and wanted me to be a part of his touring band.  He and I had grown up together playing music.  The idea of traveling the country with him and playing music was both exciting and terrifying.  Anyone who&#39;s even had the slightest fleeting thought of being a &quot;rock star&quot; should understand that this is not an opportunity that I could pass up.  I quit my job, sold most of my possessions, and moved to Wisconsin to start my career as a professional touring musician.</p>
<p>Starting off, the touring life was amazing: road-tripping with your friends, eating good food, playing music for people and getting <em>paid</em> for it.  Over time, like most things, it started to level out a bit.  I started to see it as more of a job: being away from home, eating unhealthy food, playing music for drunk people who are barely listening, not getting paid much.  I began to be honest with myself about who I was and what kind of personality I had.  I enjoyed being at home, having a routine, and not being away from my significant other.  I realized that I loved music and it would always be a part of my life, but not in the form of touring.  I love everything that I had been able to experience from touring, but after three years I needed something different.</p>
<p>Things had not yet clicked.</p>
<h1 id="advertising-again-">Advertising (again)</h1>
<p>I&#39;m back in San Francisco.  Luckily I still had friends at my previous advertising company, so I was able to pick back up my old job.  Three years after I was about to move away from ad trafficking and I found myself right back in it.  It felt different this time though.  I felt a little wiser, a little braver, and hungrier for finding my focus.  I also came armed with a goal in mind.</p>
<h1 id="engineer">Engineer</h1>
<p>After I moved to Wisconsin to begin touring, I started dabbling in simple web development.  The band I was playing with had a website, an awful looking website.  At the time I couldn&#39;t tell you <em>why</em> it was bad, but I knew it was.  I had this innate sense of pride for our band&#39;s web presence and it was hurting.  I volunteered myself to take over the site.  I didn&#39;t think I could do any worse.  I started small with basic HTML, just trying to get it to work.  Then I started to learn CSS and Javascript and I ate up every video, book, and online tutorial I could find.  It took about a year, but I finally got the website live and working.  It wasn&#39;t the greatest, but it worked.  After this, things just snowballed.  I started writing code for fun.  I would write code from the tour van.  I spent most of my free time reading about frameworks and design patterns.</p>
<p>Things had finally clicked.  This, I decided, was my goal.  To be a software engineer.  </p>
<p>Back in advertising world, I lobbied (practically begged) my company to give me a shot on the engineering team.  They understood my desire to branch out, but could not give me any definite answers.  </p>
<p>I decided that I could not wait any longer and started applying to jobs.  It took a few weeks, but I found a company who was looking for someone to start immediately and I went for it.  </p>
<h1 id="-">???</h1>
<p>I&#39;m now almost 30 and have the title of Junior Software Engineer.  Being a junior anything at 29 is a strange feeling, but it&#39;s also something I&#39;m proud of.  There are a lot of days that I wish I would have discovered web development at an earlier age.  I could have gotten a Computer Science degree and potentially been some sort of senior-level engineer by now.  At the same time, I&#39;ve gotten to experience a lot of the world that I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to experience otherwise.  I <em>know</em> that software engineering is a passion that I can make a long-term career out of because I&#39;ve tried my hand at other fields.  Risk, adventure, and honesty opened up paths for me that I would not have otherwise seen and I encourage others to do the same.</p>
