excerpt: Being a 30-year-old Junior
---

I mentioned this in previous post, but being a junior anything when you're 30 is a strange feeling.  There's some pride to be swallowed and some humbling to be had.  But at the same time there's satisfaction in the fact that I'm "paying my dues."  I've learned quite a bit so far as a junior and I thought I'd share a few tidbits.    

## First, How I Got Here

When I first began looking for a job, I wasn't _completely_ inexperienced.  I had been doing personal studying for about three years.  I felt I had a pretty good grasp on front-end fundamentals and at one point I just decided that I was going to go for it.  I pondered the idea of attending a bootcamp to give me an extra boost for the job market.  I ultimately decided that I would see what kind of responses I could get on my own and use a bootcamp as a last resort.  My feelings on bootcamps could fill their own post, but I'll leave that for now.  Suffice it to say that through the magic of circumstance, I was able to find a job as a junior developer.  

## Filling in the Learning Gaps

Like I said above, I did have some programming experience before starting my current position.  But even with that there are some things that I don't think I could have ever learned on my own: 

### Programming More Defensively

In my past experience, I was programming small-ish apps as a one-man team.  This meant that I could easily reason about pretty much anything that was happening in the app at any given time.  But after switching to a scenario where others were interacting with my code, I quickly realized how important it is to not make any assumptions about my function inputs.

### Not Taking Pull Requests Personally

I'm a somewhat sensitive person and, like most people, don't like to be wrong, so it was tough for me to learn how to take constructive code criticism.  I'm still working on it, but being able to gracefully accept code feedback will be a huge part of my future career so it's important to me to improve at it.

### Better Commit Messages

Writing more descriptive commit messages is another thing that I've learned the hard way.  It's quite embarrassing to read some of the horribly ambiguous commit messages whilst doing a pair-programming session.  My solution here (I'm sure obvious to some) is to do smaller commits.  The more code I write without committing the harder it will be for me to concisely write out exactly what I did in that commit.  I've also started to do more with [squashing](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) if I feel that some commits could be condensed.  

## Sensing The Next Level

As I've worked in the past six or seven months as a junior, I've started to feel less and less like a junior developer.  Rather than lurk, I've actually answered a question or two on Stack Overflow.  I've committed a tiny fix to a large open-source projects.  I'm just generally feeling more confident about the code I'm writing.  These are all things that I'm sure I could have accomplished on my own, but it would've taken a lot longer.  Having some peer validation goes a long way in increasing confidence.

## Junior is an Idea

However, despite what I said in the previous paragraph it's very important to me to keep my confidence in check.  There's a sort of hunger that comes with being a junior.  A hunger to learn and prove yourself and that's something I don't ever want to lose.

I hope to always be a junior at heart.
