    <p class="text-light text-lg font-medium md:text-xl">
      I help teams build web apps of all shapes and sizes. I love shipping
      practical, accessible experiences that improve people's lives.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      I'm a web developer based out of Portland, Oregon. I work at Dropbox as a
      software engineer building the Forms web application. I work heavily with
      technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>,
      <strong>Elixir</strong>, and <strong>Phoenix</strong>. I'm particularly
      interested in component-driven architecture, testing, and developer
      tooling. I love focusing on small details to get the user experience just
      right.
    </p>
    <p>In the past I've built things such as:</p>
    <ul class="my-0">
      <li>Drag-and-drop heavy interfaces with <strong>React</strong></li>
      <li>Rich text editors with <strong>Prosemirror</strong></li>
      <li>
        Component libraries with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Build and test pipelines with <strong>Webpack</strong> and <strong
          >continuous integration</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>Interactive flow charts</li>
      <li>Undo / redo implementations</li>
    </ul>
