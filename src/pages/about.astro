    <h1 class="text font-semibold">About me</h1>
    <p class="text">
      I'm a software developer based out of Portland, Oregon. I currently work
      at Dropbox as a software engineer building the Forms web application.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work heavily with technologies like <strong>React</strong> and <strong
        >TypeScript</strong
      >. I also enjoy building with <strong>Svelte</strong> and <strong
        >Astro</strong
      > and have experience with <strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong
        >Elixir</strong
      >, and <strong>Phoenix</strong>. I'm particularly interested in
      component-driven architecture, testing, and developer tooling. I love
      focusing on small details to get the user experience just right.
    </p>
    <p>In the past I've built things such as:</p>
    <ul class="my-0">
      <li>Drag-and-drop heavy interfaces with <strong>React</strong></li>
      <li>Rich text editors with <strong>Prosemirror</strong></li>
      <li>
        Component libraries with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Build and test pipelines with <strong>Webpack</strong> and <strong
          >continuous integration</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>Interactive flow charts</li>
      <li>Undo / redo implementations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I was previously at

        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        class="font-medium">Loudr</a
      > (acquired by Spotify). I have a B.S. in Management Science from UC San Diego.
