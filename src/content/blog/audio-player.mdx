description: A walkthrough of building an accessible audio player with React that includes waveforms, CSS clip-path, Tailwind, and more!
---

import { Final } from '../../components/audio-player/finished.tsx';
import FinalRaw from '../../components/audio-player/finished.tsx?raw';
import { Example } from '../../components/audio-player/example.tsx';
import { Code } from 'astro:components';

TODO

I've written a lot of custom audio players in the past. If you’re going further than adding a “play” button, things can get strangely complicated. 

This journey will have:

* React
* Tailwind
* Accessibility
* Audio waveforms
* CSS `clip-path`
* Micro interactions

Let's hit play.

## Finished Example

<Example>
  <Final slot="example" client:load />
  <Code code={FinalRaw} lang="tsx" slot="code" />
</Example>


## Setup


## Playing & Pausing


## Loading


> gif of interaction

## Current Time & Duration

## Seeking


## Audio waveforms

Waveforms

## Buffering Amount


## Hinting

## Faster time updates

requestAnimationFrame

## Responsiveness

## Refactor

- State machine
- Responsive ness
- React Aria or Radix for slider
