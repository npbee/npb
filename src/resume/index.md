            As the third engineering hire on a very lean team, my responsibilities 
            began revolved around the maintenance of an existing KnockoutJS
            application.  As my role grew, I architected and implemented a large
            React application from scratch.  Responsibilities included framework
            design and implementation, tooling and deployment, optimization,
            testing, and feature planning.
      highlights:
        - Built a unit testing infrastructure for a legacy app
        - Utilized functional programming techniques to build a large, complex
          React app with many reusable parts
        - Built an advanced searching framework to allow users to transform
          English-like expressions into API search strings intended for Elastic
          Search

        - This position required no programming experience, but I was able to incorporate productive development aspects on my own accord.  Throughout my time, I evolved the position into one that provided go-to support for our advanced Javascript functionality, simple Javascript modules for daily use, and debugging of partner sites.
        - Outside of development knowledge, through this position I have attained several years of experience working simultaneously with multiple teams, coaching and mentoring junior teammates, and communicating in a client-facing manner.
      highlights:
        - Along with a teammate, I developed an internal tool used by the entire company for daily data analysis.
        - Provided support and coaching to other team members on Say's more advanced Javascript technology.  
        - Constantly improved and documented team practices and daily functions.
