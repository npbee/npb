      <h4 class="gamma">Description</h4>
      <p>This position required no programming experience, but I was able to incorporate productive development aspects on my own accord.  Throughout my time, I evolved the position into one that provided go-to support for our advanced Javascript functionality, simple Javascript modules for daily use, and debugging of partner sites.</p>
      
      <p>Outside of development knowledge, through this position I have attained several years of experience working simultaneously with multiple teams, coaching and mentoring junior teammates, and communicating in a client-facing manner.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Along with a teammate, I developed an internal tool used by the entire company for daily data analysis.</li>
        <li>Provided support and coaching to other team members on Say's more advanced Javascript technology.  </li>
        <li>Constantly improved and documented team practices and daily functions.</li>
